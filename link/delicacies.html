                    <p> <br>
                        The Waraynon's pride, Binagol, is a famous delicacy produced by the municipality of Dagami,
                        Leyte. It is
                        from a shredded "Talyan", a root crop similar to Gabi mixed with butter, egg, coconut milk,
                        nuts, and
                        sugar. This mixture is cooked and put inside a polished coconut shell, wrapped uniquely with
                        banana
                        leaves and nylon after cooking, making it presentable. "Binagol" came from a root word "bagol"
                        which
                        means coconut shell. <br>
